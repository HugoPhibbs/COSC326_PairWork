# VideoManager

*By Hugo Phibbs and Ben Forde*

## Our Approach

- We created VideoManager as practically a static class, with a simple interface that users can use to add and remove
  VideoClips.

### Example usage

- Bellow is a code fragment on how to use our VideoManager class.

- To add a ````VideoClip```` object to the VideoManager, use VideoManager such as:

```
VideoManager.addVideoClip(new VideoClip());
```

- Then to remove a ````VideoClip```` object from the VideoManager, use VideoManager such as:

```
VideoManager.removeVideoClip(new VideoClip());
```

- Any ````VideoClip```` objects that are added can be access statically using:

```
VideoManager.getVideoClips();
```

## Design patterns

- We consider our approach to use two main design patterns, the Facade and Singleton design principles.
- We can explain the general structure of the VideoManager class with the Facade design pattern. This is due to the
  VideoManager hiding the complexity of its logic, providing a simple interface for users. This not only applies to how
  users interact with VideoManager only statically, but also specifically with methods ````addVideoClip(VideoClip)````
  and ```removeVideoClip(VideoClip)```. We decided on this design pattern to make it easy for possible users to add and
  remove VideoClips, minimising the chance that the VideoManager class is misused.
- To implement this program we thourghly studied design patterns to ensure that only one instance of the video clip
  manger would ever be created. We decided to use a Singleton Design Pattern as it ensured only one instance is created
  and provides a global point of access which we used the method getVideoclips to view the video and delete by object.
  This was implemented using VideoManager which is responisible of creating only one instance of itself and can be
  accessed directly through the data feild "instance".
